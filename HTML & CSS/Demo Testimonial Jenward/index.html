            <p>
                <q>The JenWARE onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter "a" and handmade quality made this
                    gift really stand out among the cookiecutter clothes from the department store.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Thanks for the cool JenWARE barware. I couldn't wait until I found "Mr. Right," so I just bought a set for
                    myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your site.</q>
